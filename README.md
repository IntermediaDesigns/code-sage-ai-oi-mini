This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## OpenAI Integration

This project now uses OpenAI's GPT model for code analysis. To set up the OpenAI integration:

1. Sign up for an OpenAI account and obtain an API key from the [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
2. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project.
3. Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env.local` file:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Restart your development server for the changes to take effect.

Make sure to keep your API key confidential and never commit it to version control.
